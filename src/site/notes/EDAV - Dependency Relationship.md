## Features

- Causal relationships
    - correlation ≠ causation, but we still use the y-axis for what appears to be the dependent variable
- Associations
    - describe what you see
- Outliers
- Clusters
- Gaps
- Barriers (boundaries)
- Conditional relationships
    - different relationships for different intervals of x
