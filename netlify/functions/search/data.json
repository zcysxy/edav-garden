Observations with the same movement are drawn together to show the flow.\nSome examples of data types that are suitable for alluvial diagrams are\n\nHierarchical data\nTemporal data\n\nOther than axes, we can use colors for one variable to better visualize the patterns. The variable we choose to color should be our most interested one.\nDifferent categories in axes are called strata. Without alluviums, these strata form a relative stacked <a class=\"internal-link \" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/bar-chart/\">Bar Chart</a>.\nThe height of the strata and flows represent the size of the clusters.\nImplementation\nWe can use geom_alluvium in package ggalluvial to draw alluvial diagrams.\nlibrary(ggalluvial)\ng = ggplot(\nas.data.frame(UCBAdmissions),\naes(y = Freq, axis1 = Gender, axis2 = Dept, axis3 = Admit)\n) +\ngeom_flow(aes(fill = Gender), width = 1/12) +\ngeom_stratum(width = 1/12, fill = &quot;grey80&quot;, color = &quot;grey&quot;) +\ngeom_label(\nstat = &quot;stratum&quot;,\naes(label = after_stat(stratum))\n) +\nscale_x_discrete(expand = c(.05, .05)) +\nscale_fill_brewer(type = &quot;qual&quot;, palette = &quot;Set1&quot;) +\nggtitle(&quot;UC Berkeley admissions and rejections&quot;) +\ntheme_void()\nplot(g)\n\nAn important feature of an alluvial diagram is the consistent flow, which means an observation is a continuous curve.\nWhile we can use geom_flow to create similar diagrams, where flows may not be connected. Such diagrams are only useful if you only focus on the association between adjacent categorical variables.\n\nLodes Form\n\nAble to present ghosted data, which doesn't have all categorical variables\nNeed not specify the axes\n\nTo transform a dataframe to a lodes form, use to_lodes_form(df, axes = 1:2). It works like pivot_longer in <a class=\"internal-link \" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/tidyr/\">tidyr</a>, making one row per lode.\nAn example lodes form (corresponding to the graph below):\n## Freq alluvium x stratum\n## 1 30 1 Class1 Stats\n## 2 5 2 Class1 Math\n## 3 45 3 Class1 Stats\n## 4 20 4 Class1 Math\n## 5 30 1 Class2 French\n## 6 5 2 Class2 French\n## 7 45 3 Class2 Art\n\ndf %&gt;%\nto_lodes_form(axes = 1:2) %&gt;%\nggplot(, aes(alluvium = alluvium, x = x, stratum = stratum, y = Freq)) +\ngeom_alluvium(color = &quot;blue&quot;) +\ngeom_stratum() +\ngeom_text(stat = &quot;stratum&quot;, aes(label = paste(after_stat(stratum), &quot;\\n&quot;, after_stat(count))))",

The bars can be plotted vertically or horizontally. A vertical bar chart is sometimes called a column chart.\nOne axis of the chart shows the specific categories being compared, and the other axis represents a measured value.\nSome bar graphs present bars clustered in groups of more than one, showing the values of more than one measured variable.\n\nFor unbinned data, use geom_bar in <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\"  href=\"/notes/ggplot2\">ggplot2</a>\nFor binned data, use geom_col in <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\"  href=\"/notes/ggplot2\">ggplot2</a>\nWe can use geom_text to put labels directly in/on bars\nDo not color bars when it is not necessary. Colors are needed <a class=\"internal-link \" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/bar-chart/#for-multivariate-categorical-data\">#For Multivariate Categorical Data</a>.\n\nOrdering\nThere are <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\"  href=\"/notes/edav-categorical-data#ordinal-vs-nominal\">two typical scales</a> of a categorical variable.\nFor ordinal data, sort bars in the logical order of the categories. For example, novice -&gt; advanced -&gt; expert.\nYou can sort in either direction top &lt;-&gt; bottom, or left -&gt; right).\nFor nomial data, sort bars from highest to lowest (top -&gt; bottom, left -&gt; right).\nRebinning\nWhen plotting bar plots, rows of different categories in the same category are automatically stacked up.\nHowever, when coloring, stacked bars are colored separately.\nTo bin the data by hand, we can use <a class=\"internal-link \" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/dplyr/#summarise\">dplyr#summarise()</a> with group_by(category).\ndf %&gt;%\ngroup_by(Class) %&gt;%\nsummarize(Freq = sum(Freq)) %&gt;%\nggplot(aes(fct_reorder(Class, Freq, .desc = TRUE), Freq)) +\ngeom_col() +\nxlab(&quot;&quot;)\n\nFor Multivariate Categorical Data\nFor <a class=\"internal-link \" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/edav-multivariate-categorical-data/\">Multivariate Categorical Data</a>, instead of drawing multiple bar charts (possible with facets), we can put bars for different categories together by\n\nStacked Bar Chart\n\nBetter for the overall value\n\nGrouped Bar Chart\n\nBetter for the individual value\n\nGrouped bar charts are less used but more recommended\n\nRelative Frequency and Diverging Stacked Bar Chart\n\nLikert Data\nLikert data is a special categorical data that uses a psychometric scale commonly involved in questionnaires. For example\n\nstrongly agree\nagree\ndon’t know\ndisagree\nstrongly disagree\n\nRelative frequency stacked <a class=\"internal-link \" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/bar-chart/\">Bar Chart</a>s are used to present this kind of data.\n\nColors play an important role in presenting this kind of data: we use a neutral color to present a neutral category, and use two different sets of colors for categories on two sides.\nAnother type of <a class=\"internal-link \" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/bar-chart/\">Bar Chart</a>, diverging stacked bar charts, sometimes are more suitable. They align bars with the neutral category always in the center. By doing this, the inclination stands out. ^99cd33\n\nFurthermore, we can separate and even remove the neutral category.",

		"content": "Choropleth\nA choropleth map is a type of <a class=\"internal-link \" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/heatmap/\">Heatmap</a> with units using political boundaries.\nIn a choropleth, colors usually correspond with an aggregate summary of a geographic characteristic within spatial enumeration units, such as population density or per-capita income.\n\nCompared to <a class=\"internal-link \" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/heatmap/\">Heatmap</a>, choropleths have an additional variable for each unit, that is area (and shape).\nAlso, we can think of the choice of the political boundary as a meta-variable; just like in heatmaps, we can use <a class=\"internal-link \" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/heatmap/#hex-heatmap\">hexagons</a> or squares.\nBut for choropleths, choosing an appropriate political boundary is more important; it should be determined by the nature of the data.\nLand Area Problem\nA serious problem with choropleths is that if the data has an &quot;absolute&quot; value (not relative to the area), the choropleth can be misleading. For example, the election results always show a larger red area than blue, even though more people voted for Democrats.\n\nThere are several attempts to alleviate this problem.\nCartogram\nA cartogram distorts the area of regions in order to convey the information of an alternate variable. The region area will be inflated or deflated according to the numeric value of that variable.\nNote that the variable determining the distortion and the variable determining the color are not necessarily the same. Actually, there would be redundancy if they were the same one.\nFor example, we can use color to present the election result, and distort the cartogram according to the number of voters.\n\nAlthough the graph clarifies the possible misconception that &quot;most people voted for Trump&quot;, it makes the map almost unreadable. Two ways to address this problem\n\nUse animation to animate the distortion process\nOnly distort a part of the map while keeping other regions unchanged\n\nBoth methods keep a reference to the unchanged map, with which we can compare the distorted map.\nUniform Area\nAnother approach is to give each region the same area and shape. This eliminates the area and shape variable unique to choropleths, thus reducing them to general <a class=\"internal-link \" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/heatmap/\">Heatmap</a>s.\n\nAlso, this approach doesn't convey additional information of an alternate variable like <a class=\"internal-link \" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/choropleth/#cartogram\">#Cartogram</a>s. Therefore, this approach &quot;hides&quot; the problem rather than addresses it.\nCombination with Other Graphs\nSpatial and Temporal\nIt is common that we need to combine spatial and <a class=\"internal-link \" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/edav-time-series/\">temporal data</a>. To this end, we can use facets. We can either\n\nfacet on time\n\nthen each facet is a choropleth\n\nfacet on space\n\nthen each facet can be any plot presenting the temporal data\nand the facets are laid out in a grid that mimics the original geographic topology\nthis technique is also called geofacet\n\nLinked Micromaps\nWe can also use choropleths as a legend for other plots to tell where places are. These graphs are called linked micromaps. The following example is for a <a class=\"internal-link \" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/cleveland-dot-plot/\">Cleveland Dot Plot</a>\n\nImplementation\nchoroplethr\n<a class=\"internal-link \" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/r-package/\">Package</a> choroplethr is capable of drawing state and county level maps without using shape files. The data frame must contain region and value columns, and the values of region should be recognizable by choroplethr (for example, they should be lowercase).

For example:\nconst svg = d3.select(&quot;svg&quot;);\nconst specialdata = [100, 250, 300];\n\nconst bars =\nd3.select(&quot;svg&quot;)\n.append(&quot;g&quot;) // group parent element\n.attr(&quot;id&quot;, &quot;rects&quot;)\n.selectAll(&quot;rect&quot;) // rects in the group g\n.data(specialdata)\n.enter()\n.append(&quot;rect&quot;)\n.attr(&quot;x&quot;, d =&gt; d)\n.attr(&quot;y&quot;, d =&gt; d)\n.attr(&quot;width&quot;, &quot;50&quot;)\n.attr(&quot;height&quot;, &quot;30&quot;)\n.attr(&quot;fill&quot;, &quot;red&quot;);",

It is a smooth curve that shows how often each value of the random variable occurs.\nIn <a class=\"internal-link \" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/edav/\">EDAV</a>, a density curve for some data is the density curve of any distribution that approximates the data empirical distribution.\nA common technique is to give each point a <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\"  href=\"/notes/normal-distribution\">Normal Distribution</a> with mean equal to its value. Then the density curve is the composition of multiple normal distributions.\n\nThen the variance of the normal distribution, which can be seen as binwidth in <a class=\"internal-link \" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/histogram/\">Histogram</a>, controls the shape of the curve.\n\nIf the variance is too small, then the <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\"  href=\"/notes/normal-distribution\">Normal Distribution</a> becomes a <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\"  href=\"/notes/dirac-distribution\">Dirac Distribution</a>, and the composite density curve becomes too sharp\nIf the variance is too large, then the <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\"  href=\"/notes/normal-distribution\">Normal Distribution</a> becomes a constant, and the composite density curve becomes too flat\n\nIn real implementations, such variance is controlled by parameter bandwidth h.\n\nSometimes due to the x-axis limits, the density curve doesn't go to zero at two ends (see the last graph above). We can expand the x-axis limits in such cases.",

		"content": "Time Series\nA time series is a sequence of data points, typically consisting of successive measurements made over a time interval. Visualizing time series data helps extract meaningful statistics and other characteristics of the data.\n\nWhen presenting time series data, use lines with time on the x-axis\nUse Date and Date-Time <a class=\"internal-link \" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/r-type/\">R classes</a> for time series\n\nLong-Term Trend\nTime series graphs are good for exploring overall long-term trends (secular).\nTime series are essentially discrete data and have short-term noise. We can add a loess smoother to fit the data.\n\nIn the above example, the blue curve is a global non-parametric smoother, while the red segments are linear smoothers constrained to specific time windows (groups). We can see that the smoothers eliminate the short-term noise (e.g. intra-weekly oscillations) and present the long-term trend.\nAdd a smoother using <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\"  href=\"/notes/ggplot2\">ggplot2</a>: geom_smooth(method = &quot;loess&quot;, span = .75, se = FALSE)\n\nChoose the right parameters for smoothers to avoid <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\"  href=\"/notes/overfitting-and-underfitting\">Overfitting and Underfitting</a>. Small span tends to overfit; while large span tends to underfit.\n{ #4j85jk}\n\n[!rmk] Rolling Average vs Smoother\nA rolling average and a smoother are alike, but they are not the same thing. A rolling average is fitting a constant instead of a line. Therefore, there are more jumps in a rolling average. Rolling averages only aggregate the previous information and do not capture future information.\n\nRemove Cyclical Trends\nIn addition to smoothers, there are some other methods to eliminate the noise of short-term cyclical trends. The key idea is to extract a certain point in the cycle, and show the trend of this point among all cycles. For example, when there is a weekly cyclical trend, we can focus on the trend of Monday data. To achieve this, we can\n\nHighlight/label Monday data points\nFacet by weekdays\nUse special functions like monthplot\n\nAbnormalities\nAbnormalities and outliers may violate the trend. To find the abnormalities, we can\n\nUse another feature/variable, which may be the cause of abnormalities, to label the data\nHighlight the abnormality\n\nCompare Multiple Lines\nWhen using raw data to plot a multi-line plot, some lines will dominate others. To only compare the trends instead of values, we can scale the data using\nyi′=100⋅yiy1.Gaps\nLine plots do not show the frequency of the data, and may hide gaps. We can add additional points to show the frequency.\n\nTo explicitly show the gap, we can set missing values to NA (do not remove them).\nAnother option is to use facets.",

These subcommands identify any Git objects that are outside the threshold levels set from the git gc configuration, and then compress, or prune them accordingly.\nGlobal .gitignore\nYou can create a global .gitignore file to ignore files for all git repositories.

Hexagons are more compact, provide more accurate information, and make more natural transitions. In <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\"  href=\"/notes/ggplot2\">ggplot2</a>, use geom_hex to create hex heatmaps.\n\nUnfixed Shapes\nWhen using unfixed shapes, we can think of heatmaps as colored <a class=\"internal-link \" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/density-contour-plot/\">Density Contour Plot</a>s. This kind of heatmaps is widely used for geographic patterns and thermal patterns.\n\nChanging Colors\nColors in heatmaps show the magnitudes of the phenomenon (cluster). An example to change the color: scale_fill_continuous(low = &quot;grey&quot;, high = &quot;purple&quot;)\nThree Variables\nThe color can not only represent the magnitude of the cluster, but it can also represent a third variable. By doing this, heatmaps are no longer restricted to <a class=\"internal-link \" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/edav-continuous-variable/\">Continuous Variable</a>s, but can also be for <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\"  href=\"/notes/edav-categorical-data\">categorical</a>.\nFor three variables, we cannot use geom_bin2d anymore.

		"content": "JS Functions\n\n[!tip] Built-in Functions\nThe JavaScript language has many built-in functions. In fact, some of the code you are calling when you invoke a built-in browser function couldn't be written in JavaScript — many of these functions are calling parts of the background browser code, which is written largely in low-level system languages like C++, not web languages like JavaScript.\nAnd some built-in browser functions are not part of the core JavaScript language — some are defined as part of browser APIs, which build on top of the default language to provide even more functionality.\n\nDefinition\nUse function <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\"  href=\"/notes/js-keyword\">JS Keyword</a> to define a function\nfunction myFunction(arg1, arg2) {\ndoSomeOperations;\nlet result = expression;\nreturn result;\n}\n\nReturn\n\nFunctions without return <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\"  href=\"/notes/js-keyword\">JS Keyword</a>/statement return <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\"  href=\"/notes/js-types-undefined\">JS Types - undefined</a>\nJust like <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\"  href=\"/notes/js-type#typeof\">JS Type#typeof</a>, return is both a <a class=\"internal-link \" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/js-function/\">JS Function</a> and a <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\"  href=\"/notes/js-operator\">JS Operator</a>\n\nThis means there are two forms of syntax\n\nreturn x;\nreturn(x);\n\nreturn terminate the function: the remaining code in the function definition after return will not be executed\n\nSuch code are unreachable\n\nIt is possible to use return without a value, which simply exits the function\n\nIn this case the function also returns <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\"  href=\"/notes/js-types-undefined\">JS Types - undefined</a>\n\n#R Never add a newline between return and the value\n\nSee <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\"  href=\"/notes/js-basics#js-semicolon-newline\">JS Basics#^js-semicolon-newline</a>\nIf we want the returned expression to wrap across multiple lines\n\nWe can start it at the same line as return\nOr we can wrap them with parentheses and put the opening parentheses at the same line as return\n\nInvoking\nUnlike <a class=\"internal-link \" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/python/\">Python</a>, where functions must be defined before any invoking; and unlike <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\"  href=\"/notes/matlab\">MATLAB</a>, where functions must be listed at the end of the script; JS allows to define the functions anywhere and invoke them anywhere.\nDefault values\nIf a function is called, but an argument is not provided, then the corresponding value becomes <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\"  href=\"/notes/js-types-undefined\">JS Types - undefined</a>. However, we can provide its default value in the function definition\nfunction myFun(para1, para2 = &quot;no text given&quot;) {\nconsole.log(para1 + para2);\n}\n\nmyFun(&quot;Notice: &quot;); // 'Notice: no text given'\n\nNow if the para2 parameter is not passed, it will get the value 'no text given'. The default value can even be another function call.\n#R If the default value is an expression or function, it will and only will be evaluated when the function is called and the respective parameter is not passed.\n\n[!tip] Alternative Default Parameters\nSometimes it makes sense to assign default values for parameters not in the function declaration, but at a later stage. In these cases we can check if the parameter is passed during the function execution, by comparing it with undefined\nfunction showMessage(text) {\n// ...\n\nif (text === undefined) { // if the parameter is missing\ntext = 'empty message';\n}\n\nalert(text);\n}\n\nshowMessage(); // empty message\n\nOr we could use the Or we could use the||and??<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\"  href=\"/notes/js-operator-logical\">logical operator</a>s Or we could use the\nfunction showMessage(text) {\n// if text is undefined or otherwise falsy, set it to 'empty'\ntext = text || 'empty';\n//...\n}\nfunction showCount(count) {\n// if count is undefined or null, show &quot;unknown&quot;\nalert(count ?? &quot;unknown&quot;);\n}\n\nshowCount(0); // 0\nshowCount(null); // unknown\nshowCount(); // unknown\n\nArguments\nWithin every function, there is an <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\"  href=\"/notes/js-type-array\">JS Type - Array</a>-like <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\"  href=\"/notes/js-types-object\">JS Types - Object</a> called arguments that contains the values of the arguments passed to that function.\n\nThe arguments object is not an <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\"  href=\"/notes/js-type-array\">JS Type - Array</a>: it lacks all Array properties and methods except length and property access []\n\nAnonymous Function\nWhen we don't need to store a function in a name, we can define an anonymous function\nfunction() {\n// Do something\n}\n\nYou generally use an anonymous function along with an event handler, for example the following would run the code inside the function whenever the associated button is clicked:\nconst myButton = document.querySelector('button');\n\nmyButton.onclick = function() {\nalert('hello');\n}\n\nWith event handler, anonymous function is like a when statement: it executes some code when an event is triggered.\nFunction Expression\nJust like any other type, an anonymous function can be assigned to a <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\"  href=\"/notes/js-variable\">JS Variable</a>. Such form of creating a function is also known as function expression.\n/* Define */\nlet varFun = function() {\n// Do somethinf\n};\n\n/* Invoke */\nvarFun();\n\nYou need a the parenthesis () to execute the function\n\nOtherwise you just mention the function without causing its execution\n\n#E typeof varFun won't execute the function\n\nBut unlike general function declaration, function expressions are not hoisted\n\ni.e. the <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\"  href=\"/notes/js-variable\">JS Variable</a> (function) need to be assigned first before being invoked.\n\nAnd just like general <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\"  href=\"/notes/js-variable\">JS Variable</a>s, you can also assign the function to be the value of multiple variables\n\n[!ex] Callback Functions\nfunction ask(question, yes, no) {\nif (confirm(question)) yes()\nelse no();\n}\n\nfunction showOk() {\nalert( &quot;You agreed.&quot; );\n}\n\nfunction showCancel() {\nalert( &quot;You canceled the execution.&quot; );\n}\n\n// usage: functions showOk, showCancel are passed as arguments to ask\nask(&quot;Do you agree?&quot;, showOk, showCancel);\n\nThe arguments showOk and showCancel of ask are called callback functions or just callbacks.\nThe idea is that we pass a function and expect it to be &quot;called back&quot; later if necessary. In our case, showOk becomes the callback for “yes” answer, and showCancel for “no” answer.\nWe can use Function Expressions to write the same function much shorter:\nfunction ask(question, yes, no) {\nif (confirm(question)) yes()\nelse no();\n}\n\nask(\n&quot;Do you agree?&quot;,\nfunction() { alert(&quot;You agreed.&quot;); },\nfunction() { alert(&quot;You canceled the execution.&quot;); }\n);\n\n[!tip] A Function is a Value Representing an &quot;Action&quot;\nRegular values like strings or numbers represent the data. A function can be perceived as an action. We can pass it between variables and run when we want.\n\nArrow Function\n\n$\nn-h1\n\nJS Array Function\nAnother way to create a function and assign it to a variable (this process is called <a class=\"internal-link \" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/js-function/#function-expression\">#Function Expression</a>) is called arrow function, which is similar to <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\"  href=\"/notes/python-lambda-function\">Python Lambda Function</a>\nlet myFun = (para1, para2) =&gt; expression\n\nThis creates a function myFun that accepts arguments para1 and para2, then evaluates the expression on the right side with their use and returns its result.\nIn other words, it’s the shorter version of the <a class=\"internal-link \" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/js-function/#function-expression\">#Function Expression</a>:\nlet myFun = function(para1, para2) {\nreturn expression;\n};\n\nIf we have only one parameter, then parentheses around parameters can be omitted\n\nThis gives the simplest form of a function: para =&gt; expression\n\nIf there are no parameters, parentheses will be empty (but they should be present)\nFor more complex expressions, like multiple expressions or statements, we should enclose them in curly braces {}, then use a normal return within them\n\n[!ex] Dynamically Create a Function\nlet age = prompt(&quot;What is your age?&quot;, 18);\n\nlet welcome = (age &lt; 18) ?\n() =&gt; alert('Hello') :\n() =&gt; alert(&quot;Greetings!&quot;);\n\nwelcome();\n\nFunction Scope\n\nFunctions have their own local scope, in which variables and nested functions cannot be accessed from outside\n\nEverything in the global scope can be accessed anywhere\n\nFunctions have full control of global variables, meaning that they can even modify their values and the modification is preserved\nlet a = 1;\nfunction modify() {\na = 'hello';\n}\nconsole.log(a); // 1\nmodify();\nconsole.log(a); // 'hello'\n\nIf a same-named variable is declared inside the function then it shadows the outer one\nlet a = 1;\nfunction shadow() {\nlet a = 'hello';\nconsole.log(a);\na = 'world';\n}\nshadow(); // 'hello'\nconsole.log(a); // 1\n\nThis also means that you can re-declare a <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\"  href=\"/notes/js-variable\">JS Variable</a> in the local scope of a function\n\nParameters are declared\n\nSo you can directly use parameters in the function declaration without re-declaring them\n\nParameters are local\n\nArguments passed to the function are assign to parameters, thus the variables being passed will stay intact, unless they are explicitly modified in the function\n\nlet a = 1;\nfunction intact(a) {\nconsole.log(typeof a);\na += 10; // Here a is the local one\n}\nintact(); // 'undefined', but no error\nintact(a); // 'number', since 1 is passed to it\nconsole.log(a);",

We typically represent an example as a vector x∈Rn where each entry xi of the vector is an feature.\n\nThe features of an image are usually the values of the pixels in the image.\n\nMost common ML tasks:\n\nClassification\nClassification with missing inputs\n\nWhen some of the inputs may be missing, the learning algorithm must learn a set of functions, each corresponding to classifying x with a different subset of its inputs missing\nWith n input variables, we can now obtain all 2^n^ different classification functions needed for each possible set of missing inputs, but we only need to learn a single function describing the joint probability distribution\n\nRegression\nStructured output\n\nTranscription\nMachine translation\n\nAnomaly detection\nSynthesis and sampling\nImputation of missing values\nDenoising\nDensity estimation or probability mass function estimation\n\nProbability distribution estimated can be used to solve other tasks, such as the missing value imputation task\n\nPerformance Measure P\nIn order to evaluate the abilities of a machine learning algorithm, we must design a quantitative measure of its performance. Usually this performance measure P is specific to the task T being carried out by the system.\nMost common performance measures:\n\nAccuracy or error rate: classification, structured output\naverage log-probability (i.e. <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\"  href=\"/notes/cross-entropy\">Cross-Entropy</a>) the model assigns to some examples: density estimation\n\nUsually we are interested in how well the machine learning algorithm performs on data that it has not seen before. We therefore evaluate these performance measures using a test set of data that is separate from the data used for training the machine learning system.\nExperience E\nThe experience of most ML algorithms is the dataset, a collection of many examples/data points, and an example is a collection of features.\nML algorithms can be broadly categorized as <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\"  href=\"/notes/unsupervised-learning\">Unsupervised Learning</a> or <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\"  href=\"/notes/supervised-learning\">Supervised Learning</a> by what kind of experience they are allowed to have during the learning process.\n\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\"  href=\"/notes/unsupervised-learning\">Unsupervised Learning</a>\n\nlearn useful properties of the structure of this dataset\nExamples: density estimation, synthesis, denoising, clustering\n\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\"  href=\"/notes/supervised-learning\">Supervised Learning</a>\n\neach example is also associated with a label/target\nExample: classification, regression, structured output\n\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\"  href=\"/notes/semi-supervised-learning\">Semi-Supervised Learning</a>\n\n[!ex] Blurry line between UL and SL\nThe chain rule of probability states that for a vector x∈Rn, the joint distribution can be decomposed as\np(x)=∏i=1np(xi∣x1,…,xi−1)This decomposition means that we can solve the ostensibly unsupervised problem of modeling p(x) by splitting it into n SL problems.\nAlternatively we can solve the SL problem of learning p(y|x) by applying UL to learn the joint distribution p(x,y) and inferring\np(y∣x)=p(x,y)∑y′p(x,y′)\nDescribing a Dataset\n\nMatrix - a different example in each row, a different feature in each column\n\nRequires that every example has the same features vectors of the same size\nWith a label vector in SL\n\nSet - examples as elements\n\nMethods\n\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\"  href=\"/notes/supervised-learning\">Supervised Learning</a>\n\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\"  href=\"/notes/regression\">Regression</a>\n\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\"  href=\"/notes/linear-regression\">Linear Regression</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\"  href=\"/notes/logistic-regression\">Logistic Regression</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\"  href=\"/notes/l2-regularization\">ridge regression</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\"  href=\"/notes/lasso\">LASSO</a>\n\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\"  href=\"/notes/classification\">Classification</a>\n\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\"  href=\"/notes/linear-classifier\">Linear Classifier</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\"  href=\"/notes/nearest-neighbor\">Nearest Neighbor</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\"  href=\"/notes/support-vector-machine\">Support Vector Machine</a>\n\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\"  href=\"/notes/deep-learning\">Deep Learning</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\"  href=\"/notes/decision-tree\">Decision Tree</a>\n\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\"  href=\"/notes/random-forest\">Random Forest</a>\n\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\"  href=\"/notes/ensemble-learning\">Ensemble Learning</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\"  href=\"/notes/unsupervised-learning\">Unsupervised Learning</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\"  href=\"/notes/meta-learning\">Meta-Learning</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\"  href=\"/notes/unsupervised-learning\">Unsupervised Learning</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\"  href=\"/notes/semi-supervised-learning\">Semi-Supervised Learning</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\"  href=\"/notes/reinforcement-learning\">Reinforcement Learning</a>\n\nGeneral Concepts &amp;

A diagonal elements is a vertical proportion cut of one variable.\n\nBest Practices\n\nThe order of cuts\n\nSplit dependent variables last\n\nDirection of cuts\n\nSplit dependent variables horizontally\n3 vars: VVH\n4 vars: VVVH\n5 vars: VHVVH\n\nColor fill is set to a dependent variable\n\nUse color to stress the relationship\n\nvs.\n\nThe most important level of the dependent variable is the closest to the x-axis and with the most noticeable shade\n\nImplementation\n\ngeom_mosaic in <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\"  href=\"/notes/ggplot2\">ggplot2</a>\nmosaic() in package vcd\n\nmosaic(Music ~ Age, data = counts3, direction = c(&quot;v&quot;, &quot;h&quot;))\n\nmosaic(Music ~ Age + Favorite, data = counts3, direction = c(&quot;v&quot;, &quot;v&quot;, &quot;h&quot;))\n\nHere <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\"  href=\"/notes/r-type-formula\">R Type - Formula</a> can be read as &quot;on&quot;, especially for dependent variables\n\nThere should be a Freq column in the date, which is a standard column in a dataframe\n\nuse vcd::labelings functions to\n\nabbreviate labels using option abbreviate_labs = c(FALSE, 3, 6)\nrotate labels using option rot_labels = c(0,0,0,0)\nadjust variable names using option set_varnames = c('name1', 'name2')\n\nuse vcd::spacings functions to adjust the spacing between factor levels\n\nSimpson's Paradox\nSimpson's paradox is a phenomenon in <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\"  href=\"/notes/probability-theory\">Probability Theory</a> and <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\"  href=\"/notes/statistics\">Statistics</a> in which a trend appears in several groups of data but disappears or reverses when the groups are combined.\nAn example of Simpson's paradox is <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\"  href=\"/notes/a-plausible-treatment-test\">A Plausible Treatment Test</a>.\nA visual example of Simpson's paradox:\n==&gt;\nMosaic plots can help eliminate Simpson's paradox:",

Just like line charts, parallel coordinate plots are for <a class=\"internal-link \" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/edav-multivariate-continuous-data/\">EDAV - Multivariate Continuous Data</a>.\nSlope Graph\nWhen there are only two parallel coordinates, the graph is called a slope graph.\n\nTo make the patterns in a slope graph more obvious, we can apply some data transformation\n\nStandardization: (x - mean(x)) / sd(x)\nRescaling (to [0,1]): scales::rescale()\n\nA drawback of these transformations is that we lose the actual units. A remedy is to label the units on each axis.\nMore Variables\nWe can use ggparcoord in GGally to create parallel coordinate plots.\n\nscale = &quot;std&quot; (standardization) is the default scale\nscale = &quot;uniminmax&quot; is rescaling\nscale = &quot;globalminmax&quot; is the scale without transformation\n\nOther methods to reveal the patterns:\n\nReorder the variables\n\nMaking lines cross may be better than making them parallel\n\nMake lines transparent (change alpha)\n\nInterpolation\n\nInstead of using straight lines, we can use splines or other interpolated curves\nThis helps separate lines sharing the same value of some variables\n\nHighlight a trend\n\nUse colors to separate the trend and other lines\n\nImplementations\n\nggplot2::geom_line()\n\nUse <a class=\"internal-link \" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/tidyr/\">tidyr</a> to transform variable names to x-axis first\n\nGGally::ggparcoord() (static, ggplot2)\nMASS:: parcoord() (static, base)\nparcoords::parcoords() (interactive)\n\ndevtools::install_github(“timelyportfolio/parcoords”)",

You can also do explicit type coercions.\nas.character(c(6, 8)) # &quot;6&quot; &quot;8&quot;\nas.logical(c(1,0,1,1)) # TRUE FALSE TRUE TRUE\n# as.numeric(&quot;Bilbo&quot;)\n# Warning message:\n# NAs introduced by coercion\n\nMatrix\nMatrix is a special two-dimensional data structure in <a class=\"internal-link \" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/r/\">R</a>. The class of it is &quot;matrix&quot; &quot;array&quot;.\nLike a vector, the elements in a matrix should/will be of the same <a class=\"internal-link \" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/r-type/\">R Type</a>.\nTo create a matrix, using the following function\nM &lt;- matrix([data =] data, [nrow =] 3, [ncol =] 2)\n\n[!rmk]\n\nWhen the first arg is missing, e.g. matrix(,2,2), the matrix is empty (with elements being NA)\nThe length of the first arg can be a sub-multiple or a multiple of the number of rows\nWhen the second or the third arg is missing, their default is 1\n\nIndexing\nSince a matrix is two-dimensional, the index has two arguments, like M[1,2]. When the argument is missing, it is interpreted as a colon : in <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\"  href=\"/notes/matlab-array-indexing\">Matlab Array - Indexing</a>.\nM &lt;- matrix(1:4,2,2)\nM[,]\nM[1,]\nM[,2] &lt;- 5\nM[]\n\nData Frame\nData frames are used to store tabular data (2d) in <a class=\"internal-link \" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/r/\">R</a>. They are represented as a special type of list where every element of the list has to have the same length.\nData frames are usually created by reading in a dataset using the read.table() or read.csv(). However, data frames can also be created explicitly with the data.frame()function or they can be coerced from other types of objects like lists.\nstudents &lt;- data.frame(c(&quot;Cedric&quot;, &quot;Fred&quot;, &quot;George&quot;, &quot;Cho&quot;, &quot;Draco&quot;, &quot;Ginny&quot;),\nc( 3, 2, 2, 1, 0, -1),\nc( &quot;H&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, &quot;R&quot;, &quot;S&quot;, &quot;G&quot;))\nnames(students) &lt;- c(&quot;name&quot;, &quot;year&quot;, &quot;house&quot;) # name the columns\nclass(students) # &quot;data.frame&quot;\nstudents\n# =&gt;\n# name year house\n# 1 Cedric 3 H\n# 2 Fred 2 G\n# 3 George 2 G\n# 4 Cho 1 R\n# 5 Draco 0 S\n# 6 Ginny -1 G\nclass(students$year) # &quot;numeric&quot;\nclass(students[,3]) # &quot;factor&quot;\n# find the dimensions\nnrow(students) # 6\nncol(students) # 3\ndim(students) # 6 3\n\n# There are many twisty ways to subset data frames, all subtly unalike\nstudents$year # 3 2 2 1 0 -1\nstudents[, 2] # 3 2 2 1 0 -1\nstudents[, &quot;year&quot;] # 3 2 2 1 0 -1\n\n# To drop a column from a data.frame or data.table,\n# assign it the NULL value\nstudents$houseFounderName &lt;- NULL\n\nArray\nAn array in R is a multi-dimensional homogenous (of the same <a class=\"internal-link \" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/r-type/\">R Type</a>) data structure, like <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\"  href=\"/notes/matlab-array\">Matlab Array</a>.\narray(c(c(c(2, 300, 4), c(8, 9, 0)), c(c(5, 60, 0), c(66, 7, 847))), dim = c(3, 2, 2))\n\nList\nA list is a multi-dimensional heterogeneous data structure.\nx &lt;- list(1, &quot;a&quot;, TRUE, 1 + 4i)\n\nLists are like <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\"  href=\"/notes/python-types-dictionary\">dictionaries</a>: you can give each value a name:\nx &lt;- list(time = 1:40)\nx$price = c(rnorm(40, .5 * x$time, 4))\n\n# You can get items in the list like so\nlist1$time # by name\nlist1[[&quot;time&quot;]] # by name\nlist1[[1]] # by index\n\n[!rmk]\n\nList is the only heterogeneous structure so far (<a class=\"internal-link \" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/r-data-structure/#vector\">#Vector</a>, <a class=\"internal-link \" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/r-data-structure/#matrix\">#Matrix</a>, and <a class=\"internal-link \" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/r-data-structure/#array\">#Array</a> are all homogenous)\nList also has special index—it needs double brackets\n\n[!info]\nLists are not the most efficient data structure to work with in R; unless you have a very good reason, you should stick to data.frames.\nLists are often returned by functions that perform linear regressions",

Typically, in R, we use dplyr package to do this task.\nMain functions in dplyr are called verbs and work similarly:\n\nThe first argument is a data frame\nThe subsequent arguments describe what to do with the data frame, using the variable names (without quotes)\nThe result is a new data frame\n\nfilter()\nfilter() allows you to subset observations based on their values.\nThe first argument is the name of the data frame.\nThe second and subsequent arguments are the expressions that filter the data frame (returned data frame should satisfy these expressions).\njan1 &lt;- filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1)\n\nMultiple arguments to filter() are combined with &quot;and&quot;: every expression must be true in order for a row to be included in the output.\nDon't use short-circuiting logical operators here. Because the expressions in filter() filter all the data items.\nfilter() filters out both FALSE and NA\n\narrange()\narrange() takes a data frame and a set of column names (or more complicated expressions) to order rows. If you provide more than one column name, each additional column will be used to break ties in the values of the preceding columns.\narrange(flights, year, desc(month), day)\n\ndesc() is used to reverse the order\nMissing values NA are always sorted at the end\n\nselect()\nselect() is used to select columns (variables). Some ways to fill the arguments\n\nA,B,C\nalias = A renames the column\nA:B selects all columns between A and B (inclusive)\n-(A:B) selects all columns except those from A to B\nstarts_with(&quot;abc&quot;) matches names that begin with abc\nends_with(&quot;xyz&quot;) matches names that end with xyz\ncontains(&quot;ijk&quot;) matches names that contain ijk\nmatches(&quot;(.)\\\\1&quot;) selects variables that match a <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\"  href=\"/notes/regular-expression\">Regular Expression</a>\nnum_range(&quot;x&quot;, 1:3) matches x1, x2 and x3\neverything() matches all columns, only useful when you want to move some columns to the start\n\nmutate()\nmutate() adds new columns at the end of the data frame.\nmutate(flights_sml,\ngain = dep_delay - arr_delay,\nspeed = distance / air_time * 60,\ngain_per_hour = gain / hours # refers to a column just created\n)\n\nmutate() keeps the old columns. To only keep the new variables, use transmute().\nsummarise()\nsummarise() or summarize() collapses a data frame to a single row, with values calculated by functions that take the whole data as the argument, like mean and sum.\nsummarise() is more useful paired with function group_by(). group_by() returns a grouped data frame (you can think it adds a new column group). When applied to a grouped data frame, summarise() will summarize each group.\n\n[!rmk] Ungroup\nGrouped data frame has a groups attribute, while summarise() will remove it.\nIf the data frame is grouped by multiple variables, summarise() will remove one (the last one) group variable.\nYou can also use ungroup() to manually remove the groups.\n\n[!ex] Grouped Percentages\nWhen calculating the proportions, pay attention to the groups.

If the distributions are linearly related, the points in the Q–Q plot will approximately lie on a line, but not necessarily on the line y=x. Q–Q plots can also be used as a graphical means of estimating parameters in a location-scale family of distributions.\nQ–Q plots are commonly used to compare a data set to a theoretical model. For example, collected data and a <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\"  href=\"/notes/normal-distribution\">Normal Distribution</a>.\nQ–Q plots can also be used to compare collections of data, which can be viewed as a non-parametric approach to comparing their underlying distributions.
